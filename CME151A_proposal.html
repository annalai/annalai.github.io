      <p id="intro">

        For my project for CME 151A: Interactive Data Visualization in D3, I wanted to work with a personal data set. Using D3â€™s geo-mapping tools (and borrowing from this template: http://techslides.com/demos/d3/worldmap-template-d3v4.html), I display the contries and cities I have visited. This visualization will help me see and reflect on where I have been and reveal where I need to explore next.  

        Future directions would be to update this map with new places, add time series data about the time I spent in each country by scaling the colors, and present information about what I did each place when hovering.
